# Secure-End-to-End-Encrypted Messaging in Python
A Python project implementing an end-to-end encrypted messaging system with RSA key exchange, AES message encryption, and SHA-256 integrity checks over TLS.

The system uses an RSA 2048 key pair generated by the client in DER format, where the private key is stored securely on the client side and the public key is sent to the server over a TLS channel. The server generates a unique AES-256-CBC symmetric key with a zeroed IV for each client, encrypts it with the clientâ€™s RSA public key, and returns it for secure storage. Messages are encrypted with this symmetric key, sent to the server, re-encrypted for the target client, and delivered for decryption. Registration involves sending a five-digit client identifier and the RSA public key, after which the server stores the information and issues a one-time password for verification. Each message includes a SHA-256 hash to ensure integrity, which is validated by both the server and the recipient. The message format contains a type identifier, sender ID, recipient ID, message ID, hash, and encrypted content, with all fields transmitted over TLS. The server manages a table of users with their public keys and pending messages, and a list of messages with identifiers and encrypted content.
